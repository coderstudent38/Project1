        <h3 class="pg2-tips">For lower arenas(1-5), use a simple giant support beatdown. Most people lower arenas cannot counter it because they never save up elixir to defend. A template would be giant, defense, light spell, heavy spell, splash support, single damage support, cheap spam, and any of the 3 just mentioned, depending on how you play. To start of the game, you can place a tank in the back. If the opponent rushes with a single troop, use its weakness to counter(spam=spell/splash damage troop, heavy hitting=spam, splash=single target troop.) For multiple troops, use the same counters but place one for one or more troops. With your giant, support it with at least one splash and two spells at the ready. During double elixir, add everything, spam, splash, single target, even two of the same troop and they cannot stop it.</h3>
