    <h3 class="pg3-tips">For higher arenas, it's a bit more tricky. First, find the deck archetype that fits you(hog cycle, giant control, golem beatdown). Try your best to level up all the cards in the deck. I would personally suggest golem from arenas 6-8 because most players cannot counter it with all its health. When using golem, its okay to take damage because your heavy push is going to crush everything. In arenas 6-8, there are few players that can counter your golem and take little to no damage. I would use golem, baby dragon, elixir pump, defense other than bomb tower, mortar, and x-bow, spam, support, light spell, heavy spell. Play it slow, only launch your golem when you have a huge elixir advantage or else your opponents are going to rush you. Place elixir pumps whenever possible except for when building up a push or defending. Once its double elixir, place down your golem in the back and counter his rushes with as few troops as possible. Keep on supporting your golem and use your spells until you have a huge push and at the very least take a tower. If not, just place another golem because you'll be full and its all over.</h3>
